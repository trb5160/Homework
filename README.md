# Code Refractor

Description: The previous Hortiseon website did not follow the standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act, so I was tasked on bringing it up to speed.
    To make the code more accessible to people with disabilities, I reworked it to include semantic HTML elements.

Change Overview:
    -Removed div tags and replaced them with their semantic equivalent
    -took seperate existing styles and grouped them together where appropriate
    -updated image urls
